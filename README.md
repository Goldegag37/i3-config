## I3 Config

##### Installation

2. run install.sh (this will install some packages) and go through the prompts.
(install.sh not made yet)
##### Notes

this setup is made specificly for a BLOOGUARD chromebook, <br>
so some keybinds might not make sense for your keyboard.

the repo only includes a wallpaper for arch linux.
